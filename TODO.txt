Probably recode everything from scratch. Use just the hex string and store values with Cardinal Components, then
use architectury to multiplatform


Add DataDriven animation and maybe triggers, like names or team or whatever. Like a sequence of blue red white that with white staing on for 3 seconds and the other ones for 1 etc.
They would work like "rainbow" and "random"
